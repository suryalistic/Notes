Relational Algebra Operators are used in relations:
	.Filter
	.Slice
	.Combine
The Operators are :
	. Select Operator selects some rows based on conditions denoted by sigma
	. Project Operator selects required columns denoted by Pi.
	. Cross product operator for combining every possible pair of tuples between relations
	. natural join is a join where same columns in two relations are equal. denoted using bow-tie.
	. Theta Join is a join between  two relations (cross product) and combine them by keeping the tuples that match the theta join condition.
 		denoted with bow-tie with theta symbol.	
	. Union combines the tuples of a relation vertically as opposed to horizontally as in a join, between relations of same schema.
	. Difference only projects the differences btween similar schemas.
	. Intersection is to bring out common tuples between similar schemas. similar to intersections in venn diagrams.
	. Rename is used to give a name to a selection of attributes. Primarily used to avoid dis-ambiguation in self-joins or huge queries. The selection is substituted for by the renamed selection.

Also, 
	. Linear Algebra is based on set model(no duplicates allowed).
	. SQL is based on multi-set model(duplicates allowed).
	. SQL is basically an un-ordered model.
	. Project operator in relation algebra(RA) acts like a filter
	. Syntax in RA: Project(Select (condition) Condition )
	. Cartesian product on two relations(tables) results in combined number of attributes and the rows are multiplied (n X m).
	. in RA,rows are tuples and columns are attributes.
	. in RA a simplest query is the name of the relation.
	. in DB, the joins are theta joins
=========================================================================================

.	Union in SQL by default eliminates duplicates. So, Union is a set operator. But 'Union All' is a multi-set operator and hence duplicates are seen in the resulting result set.
.	SQL primarily has Union (as in RA), Intersect (as in RA, but some dbs dont support 'intersect' keyword) and except(difference in RA) 

. in sql, multiple order by is separated by comma.
