Quick Sort:
		.Random Shuffle of array.
	To partition 
		. select a position j such that a[j] in the array is in place,  no element left to 
	   		a[j] greater than and no element right to a[j] lesser than a[j].
	   	. sort each piece recursively.
	   	. O(nlogn) - Average running time
	   	. O(n2) - worst case.
	   	. inplace - does not take extra place for sorting.
	   	. it is important to shuffle before we partition to ensure performance.
	   	. similar to merge sort, if the array to be sorted is less than a cut-off, better to go with insertion sort.
	   	. 3-way quick sort is used to speeden Quick in case of duplicate attributes.
