UI
-->login screen
place to enter userId& password. need a submit button and  a forgot password link.

-->homepage--random feeds (or) recently added feeds (or) frequently visited feeds
this is the landing page. Upon successful authentication, the user lands here.
so what else would be a better place to enter the site than the place which holds your history.
this way user feels more familiar with the site.
Clicking on any subscriptions will take to the subscriptions page and anchor on the selected subscription.
later, probably V2, we can take the preferences and feeds of the user and make sense out of them so that there is a 
suggestion engine too.

-->user profile page--update profile--add subscription urls
User profile is a place where the regular boiler plate profile management stuff takes place.
How about updating display name , change password for now. 
Going forward, V2 ??, may be customize landing page out of here and view styles i.e list, icon view of the subscriptions.
How about also linking to subscriptions page from here , V2??
 
-->subscriptions page--layout -> list on the left with preview on right (or) ....?
The curry of the site. 
This is the place where the user spends most of his time. so need to use the real estate really well.
Need to think where we place the list of subscriptions.
Need to think about the preview of the article as well as full article piece.
